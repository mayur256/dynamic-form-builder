# Dynamic Form Builder
- The *dynamic form builder* application allows a user to build/configure forms, allows the forms to be stored and retain on demand.
- These forms are stored in the form of JSON.
- Special component called *Configurator* is responsible for building the form and exports the form in form of JSON.
- A complementary component called *Presenter* reads the JSON extracted by _Configurator_ .
